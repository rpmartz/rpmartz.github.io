There's been a lot of buzz lately around the idea that [everyone should learn to code](http://code.org/). Regardless of whether or not _everyone_ needs or should learn to code, there's no doubt about the fact that knowing how to program computers is an in demand skill. I'm going to assume that you've already made the decision that it would be beneficial for you to learn how to code, and are looking for next steps to get started.

## Putting Some Myths to Rest

There's a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding programming, and I think that it erects a false barrier to entry around learning to code. There seems to be some mythical notion that if you're not a math genius or you didn't start programming by the time you stopped needing diapers, there's no hope. That's a load of crap. Sure, it's easier to learn new things when you're young, but it's not like you only get one shot to learn things.

Before making the transition to become a software engineer, I was an infantry officer in the Army and had never written a line of code in my life. I explored [Visual Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) growing up, but never got super excited about my on customized Windows dialogue boxes. I didn't try again until I was 26, and was able to pick it up just fine. Like learning anything, if you're willing to put in the effort, the results are attainable.


## The Initial Goal

Don't worry too much at first about where your programming journey is going to lead. You may find that it's just not fo you, or that you don't have too many opportunities to apply your new skills, or that you love it so much you can't believe people will pay you to do it. You don't really know until you try. Later on up the road, once you've made the decision about whether this is just something you dabbled with, do as a hobby, or want to make a career out of, you'll come to the proverbial fork in the road, but for now, just get started.

## Choosing a Programming Language

The first decision you have to make is which programming language to learn. There's no shortage of choices, and no shortage of opinions about which one is the right one to learn as a new language. I
