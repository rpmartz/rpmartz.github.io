Ok, so you want to learn how to code. Good for you. Now, where do you start?

The first order of business is to pick which programming language you learn first. There's plenty of choices, and plenty of opinions about what the "best" first language is. The truth is that for the most part, you can accomplish the same thing(s) in Language A as you can in Language B. All programs have ways to read files, transform data, output files, etc. Certain languages are better for particular tasks, and two languages might have significantly different ways of accomplishing the same thing, but at the end of the day, most languages can accomplish general purpose programming tasks.

If you have a mentor or teacher who knows a particular language well, and is willing to spend time teaching you or answering your questions, you should probably learn that language as your first language. If that's not the case, and you're trying to figure out which one to learn, then pick [Java](http://java.com) or [Python](http://python.org). If you can't decide between those two, pick Python. Read on for why.

## Decision Criteria

### Cross Platform

Your language should work across platforms. That is to say, it should work on Windows, Linux, and Mac (which is closely related to Linux). Most mainstream, popular languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and Ruby are all cross platform, for the most part. C and C++ are less portable, because they must be compiled specifically for the operating system they'll run on. Java and Python for the most part are easy to write in one environment and run somewhere else. Objective C, the language used for apps on Apple devices, or C#, Microsoft's object-oriented programming language, are less portable choices than Java or Python.

### Multi Purpose

As I mentioned above, most languages can accomplish most tasks. But some languages are used in practice for a wider array of things than others. Objective C, for example, is used more or less exclusively for apps to run on Apple devices. Ruby is used mostly for web applications with its Rails framework. Javascript is still predominately used within browsers, despite the fact that [node.js](http://nodejs.org) has brough it back into the general-purpose fold. Functional programming languages like Haskell and OCaml are usually used in specialized circumstances like the financial industry or academia.  Contrast that with something like Java, where there are rich libraries for build websites, machine learning, a desktop graphical user interface toolkit, statistics, etc. If you're just starting out, and not sure what or why you want to learn to code, it's nice to have flexibility rather than animating webpages or making mobile apps.

### Approachability

Python takes the cake here. It's syntax is much less complicated than Java, and allows you to write programs almost conversationally.

## Conclusion

Like I said above, the best language is one where you have someone to help you learn. If that's not available, then go with either Python or Java. They're both popular
