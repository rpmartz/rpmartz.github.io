As I gain more experience as a software engineer, and as the technology religious wars continue to pointlessly rage, the more I convinced I become that there are very few universal truths about software development. There are best practices, to be sure, but even many of those are context dependent. 

So, as engineers, we'd do well to take a big drink of pragmatism. Sure, tests are necessary and well-tested code is a good thing, but if your worldview requires you to _always_ maintain `X%` code coverage, you'll end up writing tests for the sake of writing tests and not for producing more robust software.
